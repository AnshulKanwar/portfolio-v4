Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Today we will create a simple app with react. This short tutorial is perfect for begineers.

<Alert type="important">

  2. You only need to know javascript for this tutorial
</Alert>

First open your terminal and run the following command to setup a basic app

```shell
npx create-react-app hello-react
```

Next cd into the newly created directory hello-react using

cd hello-react
```

[create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev) creates a sets up a simple application for us. You can run the application using

```shell
npm start
```

Your application should now be live at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

now replace the content inside `src/App.js` with this

```javascript
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
      <div className="App">
        ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
